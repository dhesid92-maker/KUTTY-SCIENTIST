A website is a collection of interconnected web pages that are stored on a server and can be accessed through the internet using a browser such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge. Each website is identified by a unique address called a URL, and it usually contains text, images, videos, links, and interactive elements that help users find information or perform specific tasks. Websites serve a wide range of purposes—some provide information, some allow shopping, some offer entertainment, and others enable communication or online services. Behind every website, there are technologies like HTML for structure, CSS for design, and JavaScript for interactivity. Modern websites may also use databases, backend servers, frameworks, and APIs to handle large amounts of data and provide dynamic content. Overall, a website acts as a digital space where individuals, businesses, and organizations share information, build online presence, or offer services to users around the world.Here is a clean paragraph-style description explaining websites (overall meaning, purpose, structure, and uses).
